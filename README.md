This is a cool box thing I think.

Here is a copy-pasted color I found on the .md basic formatting page:

##GITHUB ASSIGNMENT NOTES:
```
Today while completing the [github](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md) assignment, I practiced some .md formatting and did a couple **commits, pushes, and pulls** along with a **merge**. I am growing a lot more confident in my ability to use github, and have been practicing using it for version control in my *CS111* course material.
```
**_Conclusion: Github is an extremely powerful tool and I will likely continue to use this for a long time._**
